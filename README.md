# Computer-Network-Project-
Network of our University Computing Block

# Description
This GitHub repository showcases the network design for our university's computing block using Cisco Packet Tracer:

Detailed layout illustrating the network architecture, including routers, switches, and end devices.
Configurations for VLANs, subnets, and routing protocols to ensure efficient data transmission.
Implementation of security measures such as access control lists (ACLs) and firewalls to protect against unauthorized access.
Documentation providing insights into the network topology, addressing scheme, and device configurations.
Collaboration platform for students and faculty to explore, analyze, and contribute to the network design.
